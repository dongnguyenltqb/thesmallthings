I’m a web engineer. I grew up in Bao Loc, currently living in Saigon, Vietnam.

After graduating from the University of Science (HCMUS) in 2016, I worked with [DSquare](https://dsquare.com.vn/ "Digital Agency"), [The Coffee House](https://www.thecoffeehouse.com/ "Food & Beverages"), and [be](https://be.xyz "On-demand Transportation"). Besides that, I’m also working on a nonprofit project called [Meddling](https://meddling.io "Help reduce the financial burden on students on their interview trail.").

When not crafting web applications, reading about web development, I spend time playing sports games and sometimes cooking.
